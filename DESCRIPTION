Title: R package to estimate partial genetic correlations
Version: 0.0.1.0
Author: Ninon Mounier
Maintainer: GEMINI Collaborative <abc@abc>
Description: Adjusting genetic correlation estimates to account for the genetics of a common confounder can help better understand the role of this confounder in explaining the genetic similarity between conditions. This approach provides a way to estimate and compare unadjusted and partial genetic correlation estimates.
