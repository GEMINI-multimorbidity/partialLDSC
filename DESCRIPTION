Title: R package to estimate partial genetic correlations
Version: 0.0.0.9
Author: Ninon Mounier
# Maintainer: <>
Description: Adjusting genetic correlation estimates to account for the genetics of a common confounder can help better understand the role of this confounder in explaining the genetic similarity between conditions. This approach provides a way to estimate and compare unadjusted and partial genetic correlation estimates.
