# partialLDSC 0.2.0 (26 July 2024)

## Changes
* Multiple confounders: it is now possible to estimate partial genetic correlations using multiple potential confounders simultaneously. As a consequence, some of the arguments have been renamed (`confounders`, `confounder.names`).
* LD weights for the EUR reference population are provided within the package (Note that these are the same weights provided by the original developers of LDSC): https://utexas.box.com/s/vkd36n197m8klbaio3yzoxsee6sxo11v)
